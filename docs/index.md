# Discovery Engine 2‚ÄëCat

**A Proof Engine for Code**

Discovery Engine 2‚ÄëCat is a proof engine for generative code that addresses the fundamental challenge of ensuring that AI-generated code is not just syntactically correct, but logically sound and compliant with regulatory requirements.

## Key Features

### üîó **2‚ÄëCategorical Foundation**
Mathematical foundation for compositional reasoning about complex systems, ensuring logical consistency across all operations.

### üéØ **Non‚ÄëRedundant Exploration**
E‚Äëgraphs combined with Diversity-Preserving Policy (DPP) guarantee that every exploration brings measurable novelty.

### üõ°Ô∏è **Proof‚ÄëCarrying Action**
PCAP/DCA (Proof-Carrying Action/Deterministic Control Architecture) applies formal proof principles to code generation.

### üîÑ **Antifragile Learning**
Incident‚Üírule mechanism: every incident generates rules that enrich the knowledge base K and improve system robustness.
